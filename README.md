ATM Java Project
This repository contains a simple ATM (Automated Teller Machine) project implemented in Java. The project is divided into three main files:

ATM.java: The main class initiating the ATM project, displaying an introduction message, and invoking the main menu.

Account.java: Defines the Account class representing bank accounts. It includes functionalities for withdrawals, deposits, transfers, and user input handling.

OptionMenu.java: Manages the main menu, user login, account creation, and interactions for both checkings and savings accounts.
The project uses a HashMap to store account information and includes basic functionalities such as balance checking, funds withdrawal/deposit, and account transfers.
